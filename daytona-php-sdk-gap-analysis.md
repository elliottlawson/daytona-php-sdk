## API Endpoint Coverage Analysis

### Covered Endpoints (PHP SDK)
- ✅ `/sandbox` - CRUD operations
- ✅ `/toolbox/{id}/toolbox/process/execute` - Command execution
- ✅ `/toolbox/{id}/toolbox/files/*` - File operations
- ✅ `/toolbox/{id}/toolbox/git/*` - Git operations

### Missing Endpoint Categories (TypeScript SDK has)
- ❌ `/toolbox/{id}/computer-use/*` - Desktop automation
- ❌ `/toolbox/{id}/lsp/*` - Language server operations  
- ❌ `/toolbox/{id}/sessions/*` - Session management
- ❌ `/snapshots/*` - Snapshot operations
- ❌ `/volumes/*` - Volume operations
- ❌ `/object-storage/*` - Object storage operations
- ❌ `/sandbox/{id}/build-logs` - Build log streaming
- ❌ `/sandbox/{id}/preview-link/*` - Preview URL generation

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (High Impact)
1. **Computer Use Implementation** - Essential for desktop automation use cases
2. **Snapshot Management** - Critical for environment templating
3. **Image Building** - Important for custom environment creation
4. **LSP Integration** - Valuable for code intelligence features

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact)  
5. **Enhanced Command Execution** - Sessions and artifacts
6. **Volume Management** - Persistent storage support
7. **Advanced Sandbox Configuration** - Auto-intervals, labels, etc.

### Priority 3 (Lower Impact)
8. **Object Storage Direct Access**
9. **Enhanced Git Operations** 
10. **Advanced File Operations**

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Add Computer Use classes (Mouse, Keyboard, Screenshot, Display)
- Implement Snapshot management
- Add Image building capabilities
- Enhance DaytonaClient with missing authentication methods

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Add LSP Server implementation
- Implement Session-based command execution
- Add Volume management
- Enhance file operations with streaming

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization
- Add chart visualization parsing
- Implement object storage operations
- Add remaining Git operations
- Performance optimizations

## Technical Notes

1. **API Client Dependency**: The TypeScript SDK relies heavily on `@daytonaio/api-client` - the PHP SDK should leverage the same API endpoints
2. **Streaming Support**: Many advanced features require HTTP streaming support for real-time updates
3. **Authentication**: JWT token support and organization headers are essential for enterprise features
4. **Error Handling**: The TypeScript SDK has sophisticated error handling that should be replicated

## Conclusion

The PHP SDK currently covers approximately **25-30%** of the TypeScript SDK's functionality. The major gaps are in:
- **Desktop automation** (Computer Use)
- **Environment management** (Snapshots, Images, Volumes)  
- **Advanced development features** (LSP, enhanced execution)

Implementing these missing features would significantly enhance the PHP SDK's capabilities and bring it to feature parity with the TypeScript SDK.
